    <h2>School Leavers (16-19)</h2>
    <h3>GCSEs</h3>
    <p>GCSEs are the qualifications taken by most students aged 14-16 in the UK. They are designed to test students'
        knowledge in a wide range of subjects and are often a requirement for further education or employment
        opportunities. Some of the positives and negatives of GCSEs include:</p>

    <p><b>Positives:</b> GCSEs provide a solid foundation of knowledge across multiple subject areas and are widely
        recognized by employers and higher education institutions. They can help students develop transferable
        skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and time management.</p>
    <p><b>Negatives:</b> GCSEs can be stressful and demanding, requiring a significant amount of time and effort to
        prepare for. Students may struggle to balance their workload with other commitments, such as part-time jobs
        or extracurricular activities. In addition, the grading system can be complex, making it difficult for
        students to understand their performance.</p>

    <h3>A-levels</h3>
    <p>A-levels are academic qualifications taken by students aged 16-19 in the UK. They are typically required for
        entry into university and provide a more in-depth study of specific subject areas. Some of the positives and
        negatives of A-levels include:</p>

    <p><b>Positives:</b> A-levels allow students to specialize in specific subject areas and develop a deeper
        understanding of their chosen subjects. They are highly valued by universities and employers, and can open
        up a range of career opportunities. A-levels can also help students develop independent learning skills and
        self-discipline.</p>
    <p><b>Negatives:</b> A-levels can be challenging and require a significant amount of independent study and
        preparation. Students may find it difficult to balance their workload with other commitments, and may
        struggle with the pressure of achieving high grades. In addition, A-levels can be expensive, with students
        often required to purchase textbooks and pay for exam fees.</p>

    <h3>Btecs</h3>
    <p>Btecs are vocational qualifications taken by students aged 16-19 in the UK. They provide a more practical and
        work-related approach to learning, with a focus on developing specific skills and knowledge for a particular
        career or industry. Some of the positives and negatives of Btecs include:</p>

    <p><b>Positives:</b> Btecs provide students with practical skills and knowledge that are directly applicable to
        their chosen career path. They offer a more hands-on approach to learning, which can be particularly
        beneficial for students who struggle with traditional academic subjects. Btecs are also recognized by
        employers and can lead to a range of career opportunities.</p>
    <p><b>Negatives:</b> Btecs may not be widely recognized by universities, particularly for entry into
        competitive degree programs. They can also be limiting in terms of subject choices, as they are often
        focused on specific vocational areas. Additionally, some students may find that the assessment methods used
        in Btecs, such as coursework and practical assessments, are more challenging than traditional exams.</p>

    <h3>What is an Apprenticeship</h3>
    <p>An apprenticeship is a work-based training program that allows individuals to gain practical experience and
        theoretical knowledge in a particular field while being paid a wage. Apprenticeships can range from entry-level
        positions to higher-level roles that require more specialized skills and knowledge. They are usually offered in
        industries such as construction, engineering, healthcare, and hospitality, among others.</p>
